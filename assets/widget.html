	<p>In 2013, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded more than US$5 billion to research institutes for indirect costs: shared overhead expenses such as lighting, heat and maintenance. Institutes negotiate the rate at which they will be reimbursed. Data obtained by <em>Nature</em> reveal the disparity in these negotiated rates and show that the actual rate collected (as calculated by figures in the NIH RePORTER database) is generally much lower than the negotiated rate.</p>
	<p>Hover your mouse over a data point to reveal the institution and key stats. Use the axis tabs to select a particular section of the data. You can also select the region (or country, when outside the United States) and the type of institution for which data will appear.</p>
